Copy
AllData.csv (existing dataset)
and
NYPD_Motor_Vehicle_Collisions.csv (download from website)
before running python script


this script updates AllData.csv to AllData_new.csv with data that is not found in the API.  It also checks google maps API to fill in missing zips through street names (when possible)
